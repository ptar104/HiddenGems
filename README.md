# HiddenGems
Find interesting local restaurants and landmarks near you!

This project was done by Jacqueline Chen, Peter Koutras, Yoshi Fujimoto, and Simon Yao, for our CMSC434 - Human Computer Interaction
class taught by Dr. Jon Froehlich at the University of Maryland.

Hidden Gems is an app dedicated to helping people find interesting places to eat, things to do, and landmarks near them. Locals to an
area can added "Hidden Gems" to the map - some special store or area that's unique and local to the area. People visiting the area can
then use the app to find these gems, and check out these authentic local places.

Hidden Gens is focused on user's discovering interesting things around them. As such, we try not to give too much information to the user.
The description they get for each gem is short, and users can only see gems within a mile radius of where they are. When the user decides
a gem to go to, navigation is also built-in, as is a rating system.

To run this code, download this github into a new Andriod Studio project, and run it on on an Android device via USB debugging. For this
app to work properly, the phone must have location services enabled, and allow the application to access the device's locational data.
